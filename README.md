# Personal-site version # 1.0

Objective: I created a simple Website portfolio content using pure HTML and CSS. 

I implemented simple HTML DIVs.
I also implemented CSS positioning such as Static, Relative, and absolute.
Font styling and typography. 

#####       Personal-site version # 2.0

I implemented a couple of awesome features in my portfolio. 
Such as AOS-script for transitions, SVG heading content for visual, font awesome, and Cloudflare scrips for icons.

I also added a Technology section content with the transition.
A project location page for all future projects to display. 

The last implementation I added is a clean formal and working contact form from-spree.
